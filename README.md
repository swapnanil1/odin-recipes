# odin-recipes
A Simple html project to display recipes for odin project
Here is a possible README file for your HTML recipe website for the Odin project:

# Odin Recipes

This is a basic recipe website that I created as part of the [Foundations course](^1^) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The website consists of a main index page that has links to a few recipes, and each recipe has its own page with instructions and ingredients. The purpose of this project is to practice the HTML knowledge that I have acquired, such as using headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and semantic elements.

## Features

- The main index page has an **h1** heading with the title "Odin Recipes" and an **img** element with the logo of The Odin Project.
- The main index page also has an **unordered list** of links to the recipes, each with an **h2** heading with the name of the dish and a brief **paragraph** with a description.
- Each recipe page has an **h1** heading with the name of the dish, an **img** element with a picture of the dish, an **h2** heading with the word "Ingredients", an **ordered list** of ingredients, an **h2** heading with the word "Instructions", and an **ordered list** of steps.
- Each recipe page also has a **footer** element with a link to the main index page and a link to The Odin Project website.
- Each HTML file has a **title** element with the name of the dish or "Odin Recipes" for the main index page.
- Each HTML file has a **meta** element with the character encoding set to UTF-8.
- Each HTML file uses semantic elements such as **header**, **main**, **section**, and **article** to structure the content.

## Preview

You can preview the website by opening the index.html file in your browser or by using a live server extension in your code editor. Here are some screenshots of how the website looks like:
