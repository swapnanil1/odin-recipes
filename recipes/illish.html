        Marinate 500g of Hilsa fish with ¾ tsp salt and ¾ tsp turmeric powder,
        and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut 100g of brinjal into 5-cm chunks and slit 5 pcs of green chillies.
        Before you begin, also make a paste of 18g salt, 6g turmeric, and 50g
        water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 40g mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly and
        changes color to a pale yellow.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add ¼ tsp kaalo jeere (nigella seeds) to the oil and let it splutter for
        a few seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the marinated fish pieces to the pan and fry them for about 2
        minutes on each side until they turn golden brown. Remove the fish from
        the pan and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pan, add the brinjal chunks and green chillies. Fry them for
        about a minute or until they turn slightly brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the paste of salt, turmeric, and water to the pan. Stir well and
        cook for about a minute or until the water evaporates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 350ml hot water to the pan and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat
        to low and let it simmer for about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the fried fish pieces to the pan. Cover it with a lid and let it
        cook on low heat for about 10 minutes or until the fish is cooked
        through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat and let it rest for a few minutes before serving hot
        with steamed rice.
